# Pocket_Mirror_Story_Packs_for_Stellaris
Placeholder for my future project when i have time to work, the project is about add a fictional story from Pocket Mirror to other games.

** NOTE **

ONLY IF the AstralShift team (Pocket Mirror DEV) allow me to use some character portrait from their game.

If the AstralShift said no then then this project will be abandon because i can't draw a simple one let alone redraw character portrait (sad glorb). :[
